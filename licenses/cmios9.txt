Note: multiple devices/image files can be specified

Note: in order to move a file from one partition/filesystem to another:
      use copy and delete

Note: within cygwin shell use \\\\.\\ instead of \\.\ for Windows drives

Note: With the "-x" option, files/directories can also be accessed via "*<hex-address>" in path names,
      where <hex-address> is the hexadecimal value of the file descriptor address (for OS-9 RBF)
      or the file number (for MDR-DOS and QDOS), as shown in the directory listing.
      This can be used e.g. to access files with corrupted or non-typeable names or lost files.
      Example: rename file with bad name with file descriptor at 0x39f80  ->  move *39f80 goodname
      Warning: use at your own risk, inadequate addresses can lead to filesystem corruption or data loss!

Note: option "-L 0x100000000" corresponds to 4GB steps

Note: for shared access to devices or image-files,
      a lock-file ("-K" option and "lock"/"unlock" commands) can be used for exclusive access
      and the "restartkeep" command can be used to rescan devices/partitions/directories



File attributes:
----------------

OS-9:
  set/clear mode bits: specify +/- followed by mode-letter:
    r w e R W E S

QDOS:
  set/clear mode bits: specify +/- followed by mode-letter:
    w d s n
  set file format:
    userdef defrec binload binrec arec abinrec
  set loadable image options: specify option followed by number:
    lb= sl= la= sa=



Examples:
---------

  Access image files
  ->  cmios9 disk1.img ...

  Access image file "c:\cmistuff\mycmipartition.backup"
  ->  cmios9 c:\cmistuff\mycmipartition.backup

  Access to QDOS image files (2 floppies in first file here)
  ->  cmios9 -q2 fl0.img ...

  Access UNIX drive "/dev/da0"
  ->  cmios9 -b 512 /dev/da0

  Access Mac OSX/Darwin CD-ROM drive
  ->  cmios9 -r -b 2048 /dev/disk1s0

  Access FreeBSD CD-ROM drive
  ->  cmios9 -r -b 2048 /dev/acd0

  Access Windows physical drive 2 (if supported by the operating system)
  (Please note that logical drives like "\\.\g:" won't work
  since they correspond to PC-partitions.)
  ->  cmios9 -b 512 \\.\physicaldrive2

  Access Windows CD-ROM drive 0 (if supported by the operating system)
  ->  cmios9 -b 2048 \\.\cdrom0



OS-9 RBF and MDR-DOS filesystem sizes:
-------------------------------------

supported blocksize = 0x0100 bytes (256B) ... 0x8000 bytes (32KB)
supported max. block count = 0xffffff
=> max. filesystem size = 0x7fffff8000 bytes (approx. 512GB)

Note:
Legacy systems may restict the filesystem size to <4GB and the blocksize to 256B.
With blocksize=0100 (256B), a totsize of 0xffffff corresponds to approx. 4GB,
with blocksize=0400 (1KB), a totsize of 0x3fffff corresponds to approx. 4GB.

Note:
upper limit of file size = 0xffffffff bytes (approx. 4GB), even for larger filesystem sizes



How to initialize an OS-9 RBF disk for CMI Series III from scratch:
------------------------------------------------------------------

1.) newfs /sc00 (os9, blocksize=0100 totsize=whole disk, clustersize=1, filesyssize=0100)
2.) cd /sc00
    mkdir SYS
3.) cd /sc00/sys
    creat parttab 100 0
    linkpart (parttab)
4.) editpart (for all k- and c-partitions you need)
5.) cd /sc00/sys
    put bootfile
    linkboot (bootfile)
6.) newfs /... (for all k- and c-partitions you need)

Note:
A partition start and size should be cluster-aligned.
A CMI Series III floppy (k-partition) has 0x10cc00 bytes (approx. 1MB).
An IOMEGA ZIP100 disk has 0x6000000 bytes (96MB).
For removeable media it is advantageous to set totsize to 0xffffff,
whereas filesyssize should be set to the actual available space.



How to initialize an OS-9 RBF disk for MFX3plus:
-----------------------------------------------

newfsosk /sc00 (blocksize=400, totsize=whole disk, clustersize=80, filesyssize=whole disk)



Compilation:
------------

Depending on the operating system and the programming environment,
use Makefile (for make) or Makefile.nmake (for nmake) or the .vcproj file.
