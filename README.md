# Fairlight CMI Floppy Browser
A file browser for the Fairlight CMI floppy disk images (i.e., .HFE, .IMD and .IMG).
This software is made to ease the process of managing CMI floppies and their contents. The application allows users to intuitively open .IMD, .HFE and .IMG floppy disk images and navigate through .VC, .CO, .IN and .RS files contained inside them. It is possible to copy, extract, import and move files between floppies in a similar way as you do with normal desktop folders.

# Functionalities

- [x] .MFM disk images format (generated by MAME) support for Windows;
- [ ] .MFM disk images format (generated by MAME) support for MacOS;
- [x] Display/Modify disk information;

- [x] Listen to .VC files by clicking on the speaker icon in the file row;

- [x] Import .WAV files to disk by drag & drop the .WAV from the desktop to the disk;
- [x] Import multiple files by drag & drop or by selecting them from the "import files" menu;
- [ ] Saving in different formats (at the moment, the original extension of the disk is kept);

All the changes must be confirmed by clicking the 'Save' button after modifying the disk.
